Deskpad Installation Notes


    Deskpad is a rather lightweight calendar program written in
    Perl/Tk. In addition to Perl, you'll need to have installed the 
    Perl/Tk GUI libraries on your system.  There are source code and
    binary packages at: http://www.cpan.org/.

    Install by copying the "deskpad" program into your home directory
    or any directory that you have write permissions in.  Copy the
    man page, "deskpad.man," to /usr/local/man/man1/deskpad.1.  You
    will need to be logged in as the superuser to install the man
    page.

    If the program prints an error message like: 

      ./deskpad: file not found

    then you will need to edit the first line of the script
    with the path name of the system's perl interpreter. Usually, 
    this is the output of "which perl".

    Usage is straightforward. The program presents a window with a
    calendar of the current month. Clicking on a day opens a text
    editor where you can enter any text you like to be associated
    with that day. Selecting 'Save' from either the menu or the 
    buttons at the bottom of the editor save the text to the calendar's 
    data file.

    Refer to the file "deskpad.txt" for further information.
