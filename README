Deskpad
    A desktop calendar program like xcalendar.

    Version: $Revision: 1.1.1.1 $

    A rather lightweight calendar program written in Perl/Tk. In
    addition to Perl and its standard library modules, you'll need to
    have the Perl/Tk and Date::Calc modules.  You can download the
    source code at http://www.cpan.org/, and there are binary
    distributions available for many platforms.

    Use of the Date::Calc module is specific for more recent versions.
    (The first weekday of the month method wasn't available when I first
    wrote deskpad.)  If for some reason you prefer to use the older
    routine to find the first weekday of the month, refer to the comments
    in the source code.

    Install by copying the 'deskpad' program into your home directory
    or any directory that you have write permissions in.  

    Usage is straightforward. The program presents a window with a
    calendar of the current month. Clicking on a day opens a text
    editor where you can enter any text you like to be associated
    with that day. Selecting 'Save' from either the menu or the 
    buttons at the bottom of the editor save the text to the calendar's 
    data file.

    Refer to the file "deskpad.txt" for further information.
