Deskpad
    A desktop calendar program like xcalendar.

    Version: $Revision: 1.1.1.1 $

    A rather lightweight calendar program written in Perl/Tk. In
    addition to Perl, you'll need to have Perl/Tk on your system.
    Recent source code versions are can be found on http://www.cpan.org/,
    and binary distributions for Red Hat Linux 6.2 and 7.0 (i386), and 
    Sparc Solaris 7, are at: http://www.mainmatter.com/perltk/.

    Install by copying the 'deskpad' program into your home directory
    or any directory that you have write permissions in.  

    Usage is straightforward. The program presents a window with a
    calendar of the current month. Clicking on a day opens a text
    editor where you can enter any text you like to be associated
    with that day. Selecting 'Save' from either the menu or the 
    buttons at the bottom of the editor save the text to the calendar's 
    data file.

    Refer to the file "deskpad.txt" for further information.
