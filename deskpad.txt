NAME
    deskpad - A desktop calendar program like xcalendar.

SYNOPSIS
    ./deskpad &

DESCRIPTION
    Deskpad is a lightweight calendar program written in Perl/Tk. In
    addition to Perl, you'll need to have Perl/Tk on your system. Perl/Tk,
    as well as Perl, can be found on http://www.cpan.org/.

    Usage is straightforward. The program presents a window with a calendar
    of the current month. Clicking on a day opens a text editor where you
    can enter any text you like to be associated with that day. Selecting
    'Save', 'Delete', or 'Close' from either the menu or the buttons at the
    bottom of the editor save the text to the calendar's data file.

    The current date and the borders of the days that have events in the
    database (see below) have highlighted borders.

CALENDAR DATA
    The program creates a directory named ".schedule" in your home
    directory, and keeps its data there. The calendar data is ASCII
    formatted with XML tags. The program recognizes the tags, "day,"
    "month," "date," "year," and "text."
